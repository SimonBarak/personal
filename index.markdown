I had the opportunity to design the corporate identity for the Czech Prosecutor Institute[Czech Prosecutor Institute](https://www.behance.net/gallery/96467527/Czech-Prosecutor-Institute/){:.text-blue-400}. I was the leader of a team of students and together we designed a visual system and modular UI for Institute websites. I build a portfolio for architects [M&P Arch](https://mparch.cz/){:.text-blue-400}, CMS archive and online presentation of a studio with a long tradition. My best experience from a bigger team is for [Solidpixels.net.](https://www.solidpixels.net){:.text-blue-400}, as a front-end JS developer.

My bachelor's is design and technical development of digital product [Hlasem.com](https://hlasem.com/){:.text-blue-400}.
